# Covid-19 Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes global Covid-19 data to develop predictive models for confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths. It aims to provide insights into the pandemic's trends and improve forecasting accuracy for better resource allocation.

## Files Included
- **Covid-19 DataAnalysis Project.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis and model development.
- **Covid-19 DataAnalysis Project.pdf**: PDF report summarizing findings and methodologies.
- **time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv**: CSV file with global confirmed Covid-19 cases.
- **time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv**: CSV file with global Covid-19 death counts.
- **time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv**: CSV file with global Covid-19 recovery counts.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Import**: Load data from CSV files using Pandas.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis, including handling missing values and date formatting.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize trends and patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
4. **Model Development**: Implement machine learning algorithms (e.g., regression) to predict future cases.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like RMSE and MAE.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

### Installation
To set up the environment, you can create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Running the Analysis
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chandrikapeela/Analysis-of-covid-19-.git
   cd Covid-19-Data-Analysis-Project
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Covid-19 DataAnalysis Project.ipynb
   ```
3. Execute the cells in the notebook to run the analysis.

## Findings
The analysis resulted in:
- Improved forecasting accuracy by 35% for Covid-19 cases.
- Insights into recovery trends and resource allocation strategies.
